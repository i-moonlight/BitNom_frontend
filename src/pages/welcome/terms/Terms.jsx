            hold any Protected Parties liable should any of the following risks
            occur:

            <li>
              <strong>
                Risk of Regulatory Actions in One or More Jurisdictions:
              </strong>
              &nbsp;The Portal or the Services or the Link Token could be
              impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory
              actions, which could impede or limit the ability of Company to
              continue to develop the Portal or Services, or which could impede
              or limit your ability to use the Portal or Services or the Link
              Token.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Risk of Alternative, Unofficial Bitnorm Networks:</strong>
              &nbsp;It is possible that alternative Bitnorm-based networks could
              be established, which utilize the same open source code and open
              source protocol underlying the Portal and/or Services. The Bitnorm
              network may compete with these alternative Bitnorm-based networks,
              which could potentially negatively impact the Portal, Services
              and/or the Link Token.

              <strong>
                Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Bitnorm Network or
                Distributed Applications:
              </strong>
              &nbsp;It is possible that the Bitnorm be network will not be used
              by a large number of external businesses, individuals, and other
              organizations and that there will be limited public interest in
              the creation and development of distributed applications. Such a
              lack of interest could impact the development of the Bitnorm
              network and potential uses of Link Tokens. The Company cannot
              predict the success of its own development efforts or the efforts
              of other third parties.

              </strong>
              &nbsp;You recognize that the Portal, Services and the Bitnorm
              network are under development and may undergo significant changes
              over time. You acknowledge that any expectations regarding the
              form and functionality of the Bitnorm network held by you may not
              be met upon release of the Portal, Services or the Bitnorm
              network, for any number of reasons including a change in the
              design and implementation plans, specifications and execution of

                Risk of Security Weaknesses in the Bitnorm Network Core
                Infrastructure Software:
              </strong>
              &nbsp;The Portal, Services and the Bitnorm network rest on
              open-source software, and there is a risk that the Protected
              Parties, or other third parties not directly affiliated with
              Company, may introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core
              infrastructural elements of the Portal, Services or the Bitnorm
              network causing the system to lose Link Tokens stored in one or
              more of your accounts or other accounts or lose sums of other
              valued tokens. Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to
              develop and maintain the Portal, Services and the Bitnorm network,
              the Portal, Services and the Bitnorm network may experience
              malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or
              maintained, which may negatively impact the Portal, Services, the
              Bitnorm network and Link Tokens.

                Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of
                Cryptography:
              </strong>
              &nbsp;Cryptography is an art, not a science. And the state of the
              art can advance over time. Advances in code cracking, or technical
              advances such as the development of quantum computers, could
              present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Portal, Services and the
              Bitnorm network which could result in the theft or loss of Link
              Tokens. To the extent within its control and otherwise possible,
              Company intends to update the protocol underlying the Portal,
              Services and the Bitnorm network to account for any advances in
              cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but
              it cannot predict the future of cryptography or guarantee that any

              <strong>Risk of Blockchain Network Attacks:</strong>&nbsp;Any
              blockchain used for the Portal, Services and/or the Bitnorm
              network may be susceptible to mining attacks, including but not
              limited to: double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks,
              “selfish-mining” attacks, and work race condition attacks. Any
              successful attacks present a risk to the Portal, Services, the
              Bitnorm Network, expected proper execution and sequencing of
              transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of
              contract computations. Known or novel mining attacks may be

                Application Processing Power of the Portal, Services and the
                Bitnorm Network:
              </strong>
              &nbsp;If the Portal, Services and/or the Bitnorm network are
              rapidly adopted, the demand for transaction processing and
              distributed application computations could rise dramatically and
              at a pace that exceeds the rate with which Company services can be
              provided. Under such a scenario, the entire Portal, Services and
              Bitnorm network could become destabilized, due to the increased
              cost of running distributed applications. In turn, this could
              dampen interest in the Portal, Services, the Bitnorm network and
              Link Tokens. Insufficiency of computational resources and an
              associated rise in the price of Link Tokens could result in
              businesses being unable to acquire scarce computational resources
              to run their distributed applications. This could result in lost
              revenues and disruption or halting of business operations.

            <li>
              <strong>Risks Associated with New and Evolving Laws:</strong>
              &nbsp;The Bitnorm network, and by extension the Portal and
              Services, may be subject to a variety of international laws and
              regulations, including those with respect to financial or
              securities regulations, consumer privacy, data protection,
              consumer protection, content regulation, network neutrality, cyber
              security, data protection, intellectual property (including
              copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws), defamation,
              and others. Such laws and regulations, and the interpretation or
              application of these laws and regulations, could change. In
              addition, new laws or regulations affecting the Company could be
              enacted. As the Portal, Services and Bitnorm network evolve, we
              may be subject to new laws, and the application of existing laws
              to us might change. These laws and regulations are frequently
              costly to comply with and may divert a significant portion of
              Company’s attention and resources or restrict the way the Company
              may operate. If we fail to comply with these applicable laws or
              regulations, we could receive negative publicity and be subject to
              significant liabilities which could adversely impact the Company,
              the Portal, Services, the Bitnorm network and Link Tokens.
              Additionally, Bitnorm node operators of the Bitnorm network may be
              subject to industry specific laws and regulations or licensing
              requirements. If any of these parties fails to comply with any of
              these licensing requirements or other applicable laws or
              regulations, or if such laws and regulations or licensing
              requirements become more stringent or are otherwise expanded, the
              Bitnorm Network and/or Link Tokens could be adversely impacted.

            <li>
              <strong>Market Risks:</strong>&nbsp;Link Tokens are intended to be
              used solely in connection with the Bitnorm network, and we do not
              support or otherwise facilitate any secondary trading or external
              valuation of Link Tokens. This restricts the contemplated avenues
              for using Link Tokens, and could therefore create illiquidity risk
              to Link Tokens you hold. Even if secondary trading of Link Tokens
              is facilitated by third party exchanges, such exchanges may be
              relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight,
              making them more susceptible to market-related risks. Furthermore,
              to the extent that third parties do ascribe an external exchange
              value to Link Tokens (e.g., as denominated in a digital or fiat
              currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to
              zero.

                Specific Risks Relating to Value and Function of Link Tokens:
              </strong>
              &nbsp;The utility benefits of using Link Tokens to access services
              provided by Bitnorm node operators can only materialize through
              user-driven adoption over time. Such adoption depends on a variety
              of factors, including the pace of user adoption, the organic
              community-driven expansion of the Bitnorm network. As such, the
              extent of user adoption is entirely outside of our control and
              cannot be stated with any certainty. The price of Link Tokens may
              fluctuate in response to competitive and market conditions
              affecting the general supply of and demand for user-requested
              services. These conditions are beyond our control. The value of
              Link Tokens on the Bitnorm network may be lower than the price at
              which it was purchased. The utility of Link Tokens, and any value
              associated with that utility, will depend on the ability of the
              Bitnorm network to adequately facilitate user-requested services.
              Inadequate supply may result in such services taking more time,
              while inadequate demand may make it difficult to obtain services,
              both of which may discourage participation in the Bitnorm network.
              The compensation for providing Bitnorm node services in the
              Bitnorm network will depend on the resale price for the Link
              received for such services, which may be lower than the
              compensation that might have been received through other
              arrangements. No promises of future performance or value are or
              will be made with respect to Link Token, including no promise of
              inherent value, no promise of continuing payments, and no
              guarantee that Link Token will hold any particular value.

              <strong>Unanticipated Risks:</strong>&nbsp;Cryptographic tokens
              such as Link Tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition
              to the risks included in these Terms, there are other risks
              associated with the the Portal, Services, the Bitnorm network and
              Link Tokens, including those that the Company cannot anticipate.
              Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or
              combinations of the risks discussed in these Terms.

            Any right or remedy of Bitnorm set forth in these Terms is in
            addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right or remedy whether
            described in these Terms, under Applicable Law, at law or in equity.
            Our failure or delay in exercising any right, power, or privilege
            under these Terms will not operate as a waiver thereof. The
            invalidity or unenforceability of any of these Terms will not affect
            the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of
            which will remain in full force and effect. We will have no
            responsibility or liability for any failure or delay in performance
            of the Portal or any of the Services, or any loss or damage that you
            may incur, due to any circumstance or event beyond our control,
            including without limitation any flood, extraordinary weather
            conditions, earthquake, or other act of God, fire, war,
            insurrection, riot, labor dispute, accident, action of government,
            communications, power failure, or equipment or software malfunction.
            You may not assign or transfer any right to use the Portal or the
            Services, or any of your rights or obligations under these Terms,
            without our express prior written consent, including by operation of
            law or in connection with any change of control. We may assign or
            transfer any or all of our rights or obligations under these Terms,
            in whole or in part, without notice or obtaining your consent or
            approval. Headings of sections are for convenience only and will not
            be used to limit or construe such sections. These Terms contain the
            entire agreement and supersede all prior and contemporaneous
            understandings between the parties regarding the Portal and the
            Services. If there is a conflict between these Terms and any other
            agreement you may have with us, these Terms will control unless the
            other agreement specifically identifies these Terms and declares
            that the other agreement supersedes these Terms.
