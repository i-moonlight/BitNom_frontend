                            &nbsp;Cryptography is an art, not a science. And the
                            state of the art can advance over time. Advances in
                            code cracking, or technical advances such as the
                            development of quantum computers, could present
                            risks to cryptocurrencies and the Portal, Services
                            and the Bitnorm network which could result in the
                            theft or loss of Link Tokens. To the extent within
                            its control and otherwise possible, Company intends
                            to update the protocol underlying the Portal,
                            Services and the Bitnorm network to account for any
                            advances in cryptography and to incorporate
                            additional security measures, but it cannot predict

                            security updates will be made in a timely or

                            &nbsp;Any blockchain used for the Portal, Services
                            and/or the Bitnorm network may be susceptible to
                            mining attacks, including but not limited to:
                            double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks,
                            “selfish-mining” attacks, and work race condition
                            attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to
                            the Portal, Services, the Bitnorm Network, expected
                            proper execution and sequencing of transactions, and
                            expected proper execution and sequencing of contract
                            computations. Known or novel mining attacks may be
                            successful.

                            transaction processing and distributed application
                            computations could rise dramatically and at a pace
                            that exceeds the rate with which Company services
                            can be provided. Under such a scenario, the entire
                            Portal, Services and Bitnorm network could become
                            destabilized, due to the increased cost of running
                            distributed applications. In turn, this could dampen
                            interest in the Portal, Services, the Bitnorm
                            network and Link Tokens. Insufficiency of

                            the price of Link Tokens could result in businesses
                            being unable to acquire scarce computational
                            resources to run their distributed applications.
                            This could result in lost revenues and disruption or
                            halting of business operations.

                            &nbsp;The Bitnorm network, and by extension the
                            Portal and Services, may be subject to a variety of
                            international laws and regulations, including those
                            with respect to financial or securities regulations,
                            consumer privacy, data protection, consumer

                            property (including copyright, patent, trademark and
                            trade secret laws), defamation, and others. Such
                            laws and regulations, and the interpretation or
                            application of these laws and regulations, could
                            change. In addition, new laws or regulations
                            affecting the Company could be enacted. As the
                            Portal, Services and Bitnorm network evolve, we may
                            be subject to new laws, and the application of
                            existing laws to us might change. These laws and
                            regulations are frequently costly to comply with and
                            may divert a significant portion of Company’s
                            attention and resources or restrict the way the
                            Company may operate. If we fail to comply with these
                            applicable laws or regulations, we could receive
                            negative publicity and be subject to significant
                            liabilities which could adversely impact the

                            laws and regulations or licensing requirements
                            become more stringent or are otherwise expanded, the
                            Bitnorm Network and/or Link Tokens could be

                            <strong>Market Risks:</strong>&nbsp;Link Tokens are
                            intended to be used solely in connection with the
                            Bitnorm network, and we do not support or otherwise
                            facilitate any secondary trading or external
                            valuation of Link Tokens. This restricts the
                            contemplated avenues for using Link Tokens, and
                            could therefore create illiquidity risk to Link
                            Tokens you hold. Even if secondary trading of Link
                            Tokens is facilitated by third party exchanges, such
                            exchanges may be relatively new and subject to
                            little or no regulatory oversight, making them more
                            susceptible to market-related risks. Furthermore, to
                            the extent that third parties do ascribe an external
                            exchange value to Link Tokens (e.g., as denominated
                            in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be
                            extremely volatile and diminish to zero.

                            </strong>
                            &nbsp;The utility benefits of using Link Tokens to
                            access services provided by Bitnorm node operators
                            can only materialize through user-driven adoption
                            over time. Such adoption depends on a variety of
                            factors, including the pace of user adoption, the
                            organic community-driven expansion of the Bitnorm
                            network. As such, the extent of user adoption is
                            entirely outside of our control and cannot be stated
                            with any certainty. The price of Link Tokens may
                            fluctuate in response to competitive and market
                            conditions affecting the general supply of and
                            demand for user-requested services. These conditions
                            are beyond our control. The value of Link Tokens on
                            the Bitnorm network may be lower than the price at
                            which it was purchased. The utility of Link Tokens,
                            and any value associated with that utility, will
                            depend on the ability of the Bitnorm network to
                            adequately facilitate user-requested services.
                            Inadequate supply may result in such services taking
                            more time, while inadequate demand may make it
                            difficult to obtain services, both of which may
                            discourage participation in the Bitnorm network. The
                            compensation for providing Bitnorm node services in
                            the Bitnorm network will depend on the resale price
                            for the Link received for such services, which may
                            be lower than the compensation that might have been
                            received through other arrangements. No promises of
                            future performance or value are or will be made with
                            respect to Link Token, including no promise of
                            inherent value, no promise of continuing payments,
                            and no guarantee that Link Token will hold any
                            particular value.
