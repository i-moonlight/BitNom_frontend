                        The website uses cookies. Cookies are text files that
                        are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.
                        More detailed information on cookies and how they work
                        can be found at: http://www.allaboutcookies.org.

                    <p>
                        Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many
                        cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a
                        unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a
                        character string through which Internet pages and
                        servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser
                        in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited
                        Internet sites and servers to differentiate the
                        individual browser of the data subject from other
                        Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific
                        Internet browser can be recognized and identified using
                        the unique cookie ID.

                        Through the use of cookies, the Foundation can provide
                        the users of this website with more user-friendly
                        services that would not be possible without the cookie
                        setting.

                        Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize
                        our websites users. The purpose of this recognition is
                        to make it easier for users to utilize our websites. The
                        website's user that uses cookies e.g. does not have to
                        enter access data each time the website is accessed,
                        because this is taken over by the website, and the
                        cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies
                        through our websites by means of a corresponding setting
                        of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently
                        deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, previously set
                        cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet
                        browser or other software programs. This is possible in
                        all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject
                        deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet
                        browser used, it may not be possible to use all the
                        functions of our websites.
