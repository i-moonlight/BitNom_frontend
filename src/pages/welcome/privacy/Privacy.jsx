            The latest privacy policy has incorporated elements from the General

            <strong>Use of Websites Cookies</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            The website uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in
            a computer system via an Internet browser. More detailed information
            on cookies and how they work can be found at:
            http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a
            so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the
            cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet
            pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser
            in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites
            and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data
            subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A
            specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the
            unique cookie ID.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through the use of cookies, the Foundation can provide the users of
            this website with more user-friendly services that would not be
            possible without the cookie setting.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our websites
            users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for
            users to utilize our websites. The website's user that uses cookies
            e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the website is
            accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie
            is thus stored on the user's computer system.
          </p>

          <p>
            You may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our
            websites by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser
            used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.
            Furthermore, previously set cookies may be deleted at any time via
            an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in
            all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the
            setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, it may not be
            possible to use all the functions of our websites.
